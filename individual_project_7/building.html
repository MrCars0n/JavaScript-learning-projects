    Project 6, 3rd requirement: Necessity of Validation and XSS Attack Planning

    Web security requires validation because it shields a website and its visitors from a variety of threats, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). 
    We can give users instant feedback and stop invalid data from being transferred to the server by verifying input on the client side. 
    However, client-side validation alone is not enough, as attackers can bypass it by using tools to manipulate form submissions. 
    In order to completely inspect and sanitize inputs and guarantee that only valid data is processed and stored, server-side validation must also be implemented.

    Inadequate validation frequently results in vulnerabilities like XSS, which allows an attacker to insert malicious code into input fields. 
    If these scripts are not cleaned up, other website visitors may run them and take advantage of them, which could result in data theft, session hijacking, or other illegal activities. 
    For instance, if JavaScript could be entered into the "Minecraft Username" field of this form, it could be saved and run each time the form's data is shown. 
    Because of this, input sanitization and validation are essential procedures for safeguarding websites and averting potential exploitation.
