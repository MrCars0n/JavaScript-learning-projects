    <h2>Background Information</h2>
    <p>
        I am from Mechanicsburg, PA, and I am majoring in Computer Science with a focus on Software Engineering. 
        As a senior, I am part of the Class of 2025.

    <p>
        An interesting fact about me is that I have visited 9 National Parks this summer, and my goal is to visit all of them. 
        I enjoy exploring the beauty of nature and experiencing the unique landscapes each park has to offer.

    <h2>Applying a Biblical Worldview</h2>
    <p>
        In this client-side programming course, I can apply a biblical worldview by recognizing that the skills and knowledge we acquire 
        are gifts from God, meant to be used for good and to serve others. As Colossians 3:23 (<i>New International Version</i>, 2011) states, 
        "Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters." This verse inspires me to strive to honor God in all that I do, including my approach to my education and classes with dedication and integrity.
